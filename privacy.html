<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Last updated Febuary 8th, 2017</p>
<h2>My Privacy Commitment</h2>

<p>Welcome to dotdatabase.net (“dotdatabase,” “dotdatabase.net,” “I” ) is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the service provided on or through my website, 
including www.dotdatabase.net (the “Site(s)”). As such, I have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site(s) how I use and protect the information I collect through the Site(s). 
By visiting the Site(s), you consent to the collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth 
above and is only applicable to the Site(s) and not to any other website or third party software applications that you may be able to access from the Site(s) which may have their own data collection and use practices and policies.
</p>

<p>This policy answers the following questions:
<ul>
    <li>What information do I collect about you and how do I use it?</li>
    <li>Will I share your personal information with third parties?</li>
    <li>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Types of Information I Collect</h3>

<p>Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You do not need to submit personal information to access my Site(s).</p>

<p>I do not collect personal information, except when you leave User Submitted Content on my Site(s).</p>

<p>To leave a comment on the Site(s), which is the only way to submit user content, you need to provide a screen name, which doesn't have to be your real name - it can be any name, and a comment.

There is no necessity to provide personal information and therefore it is also discouraged, since it will be viewable by the public. The only information that is collected during the process is your IP 
address.</p>
<h4>How I Use Your Personal Information</h4>

<p> For the sake of IP-banning spam bots or vandalising individuals, if the need ever arises, I collect the IP address of every individual that leaves a comment on the Site(s). This information is not shared with anyone and 
only logged to improve the website.</p>

<div id="Cookies"><h4>Cookies</h4></div>

allow me to provide information which is targeted to your interests and to make your online experience more convenient. Additionally, advertisements that are managed by third parties which may appear on the Site(s) 
use cookies. Advertisers use cookies to collect non-personal information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected. 
Advertisers use this information to monitor the performance of their advertisements. In some cases, I may have access to information from cookies used by these advertisers on the Site(s) and this information may 
permit me to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with such advertisers.</p>

<h4>Log Information</h4>

<p>The servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit my Site(s). Additionally, some of the Site(s) may collect information regarding your computer 
system when you leave User Submitted Content. This information includes your Internet Protocol address. I use this information to monitor and analyze how users use the Sites(s), to maintain and improve the Site(s).</p>

<h3>Will I share your personal information with third parties?</h3>
<h4>Sharing of Information</h4>

<p>I won't share any personal information that I collect unless under the following circumstance:</p>

<p>Protection of rights. I will share personal information if I have a good faith belief that (i) access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, 
legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental authorities, (ii) such action is appropriate to enforce the Terms of Service for the Site(s), including any investigation 
of potential violations thereof, (iii) such action is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Site(s), or (iv) such action is appropriate to protect the 
rights, property or safety of myself, users of the Site(s) or others.</p>


<h4>Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties</h4>

<p>The Site(s) may contain direct links to websites operated by my business partners and other third party entities. These third party websites may collect information about you when you visit them or otherwise communicate 
with them. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to the Site(s). Although I encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, I 
am not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites 
to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.</p>

<p>When you have clicked on an advertisement or third party logo or URL displayed on my Site(s) which links you to a different website, my Privacy Policy no longer applies and 
you must read the privacy policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.</p>

<p>The Site(s) may also have chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When you post to a chat area, please be aware that 
the information you post is made publicly available on-line and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h3>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</h3>
<h4>Control of Your Information</h4>

<p>I may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site(s). These companies may use information about your interests in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see the Digital Advertising Alliance's or Network Advertising Initiative's website.</p>

<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>

<p>From time to time, I may update this Privacy Policy. I will notify you about material changes by prominently posting a notice on the Site(s). I encourage you to periodically check back and review this 
Privacy Policy so that you always will know what information I collect, how I use it, and with whom I share it.</p>
